# Java-Dsa
 Started Dsa with Apna college in java.
# Day 1

# Day 2
Today the class was based on variable and data types and I practiced the primary function of algebras, taking  input  using a scanner, type conversion, and type casting.
# Day 3
today it was the class about Operators in which I studied different types of operators like arithmetic, logical, and many more and also practiced some questions based on this.
